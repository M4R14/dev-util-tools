 * The shapes a family tree is made of, and nothing that acts on them.

 * `FamilyMember` or `FamilyNode` to type a prop and never call a single operation. Keeping the
 * declarations free of zod, of `randomUUID`, and of each other means naming a type costs nothing.
 *
 * A tree is stored as a **flat list**, each member pointing at one parent. Every operation the tool
 * offers — rename, re-parent, delete, import — is a lookup by id, and a nested shape turns each of
 * those into a recursive rewrite. The nesting is derived on read by `buildHierarchy`.
